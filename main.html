	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure used to describe how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the input size increases. An algorithm with low time complexity is considered efficient because it processes data faster, especially as the dataset grows.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. For example, an algorithm that requires memory proportional to the input size has a space complexity of O(n), meaning the memory usage grows linearly with the input.
